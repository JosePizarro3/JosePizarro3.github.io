    <h1>Research Journey</h1>
    <p>
        In my research, I have delved into understanding strong electronic correlations in different materials. These correlations
        are crucial for certain physical phenomena; they help explaining real materials behaviors such as superconductivity and
        magnetism. They are also key in understanding how materials interact with external electromagnetic fields.
        
        As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_materials_science">Computational Materials Scientist</a>, I 
        am an expert in analyzing these complex behaviors and in developing highly optimized codes. In order to do that, I 
        have always tried to follow a few key principles:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Exploring systematically electronic-structure phases of real materials.
        </li>
        <li>
            Engaging with experimental colleagues to corroborate my discoveries.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assisting experimental teams by providing a robust theoretical framework for their findings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Performing outstanding Software Development and Data Management.
        </li>
    </ul>
