        During my career, I investigated the role of electronic correlations in different materials, mainly high-Tc
        superconductors (cuprates, iron-based superconductors, twisted bilayer graphene). I always tried to:

        <li>
            Explore electronic-structure phases and propose new and easy-to-do experiments to verify my findings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help experimental colleagues with the theoretical background behind their data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Perform outstanding data management following the F.A.I.R. principles.
        </li>
