    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        During my career, I investigated the role of electronic correlations in different materials, mainly high-Tc
        superconductors (cuprates, iron-based superconductors, twisted bilayer graphene). I always tried to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Explore electronic-structure phases and propose new and easy-to-do experiments to verify my findings.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help experimental colleagues with the theoretical background behind their data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Perform outstanding data management following the F.A.I.R. principles.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mott physics in high-Tc superconductors</h3>
    <p>
        My main scientific activity has been to study and propose novel experiments for understanding the physics of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_insulator">Mott insulators</a> and Hund's metals. These 
        electronic-structure states are known to be intimately related with high-Tc superconducting phases. 
        Thus, understanding these states is a key ingredient to solve the long-standing problem of high-Tc superconductivity.

                My collaborators and I proposed to search for high-Tc superconductivity in chromium pnictides due
                to their similarity with the iron-based superconductors.

    <h3>Code development</h3>
    <p>
        Solving and understanding electrons behavior in high-Tc superconductors is computationally very demanding. The 
        main model that I solved was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model">Hubbard model</a> and extensions of it. 
        This is a model that has been known for decades but whose exact solution is not possible to obtain, so it
        often implies developing new approximations and methodologies to reach meaningful solutions. Thus I worked
        on implementing new approximations, e.g., the
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.205124">slave-spin mean-field</a> method,
        and on optimizing the code defining new algorithms and using massive parallelization.

    <h3>Data management and FAIR principles</h3>
    <p>
        As of 2023, I am working in Data Management and I am involved in Data Science activities. My goal is to
        provide service,
        using the <a href="https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/">NOMAD Archive & Repository</a>, for calculations that are computationally
        demanding (such as the ones I studied during my career). In order to do that, I am working in the
        <a href="https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/">consortium FAIRmat</a>, where I try to organize data following 
        the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>.
