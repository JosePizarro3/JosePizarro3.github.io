            <h1>Research</h1>
            <p>
                During my scientific career, I investigated the role of electronic correlations for different materials.
                I always tried to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Study the role of the electronic correlations in high-Tc superconductors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Explore electronic-structure phases and propose new and easy-to-do experiments to verify my findings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Help experimental colleagues with the theoretical background behind their data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data management following the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mott physics in high-Tc superconductors</h3>
            <p>
                The main activity of my career is to study and propose novel experiments for understanding the physics of 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_insulator">Mott insulators</a> and Hund's metals. These 
                electronic-structure states are known to be intimately related with high-Tc superconducting states. 
                Thus, understanding these states is a key ingredient to solve the long-standing problem of high-Tc superconductivity.

                        My collaborators and I proposed to search for high-Tc superconductivity in chromium pnictides due
                        to their similarity with the iron-based superconductors.

            <h3>Code development</h3>
            <p>
                Solving and understanding the electrons behavior in high-Tc superconductors is computationally very demanding. The 
                main model that I solved was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbard_model">Hubbard model</a>. 
                This is a model that has been known for decades but whose exact solution is not possible to obtain, so it
                often implies developing new approximations and methodologies to get solutions for it. Thus I worked
                on implementing new approximations, e.g.,
                <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.72.205124">Slave-spin mean-field</a> method,
                and optimizing the code defining new algorithms and with massive parallelization.

            <h3>Data management and FAIR principles</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working in Data Management for Materials Scientists. My goal is to provide service,
                using <a href="https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/">NOMAD-lab</a>, to calculations that are computationally
                demanding (such as the ones I studied during my career). In order to do that, I am working in the
                <a href="https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/">FAIRmat consortium</a>, where I try to organize data following 
                the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>.
