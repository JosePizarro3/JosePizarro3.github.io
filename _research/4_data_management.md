title: Data Management
---

A key aspect of Science that is often overlooked is the management of the data that is produced. Following a set of good practices 
in Data Management is very important to keep the data that we, scientists, produce in a consistent way. Furthermore, it allows to 
exploit the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and Machine-Learning techniques, possibly opening new routes to find new materials
or to explain long-standing problems, such as the one of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity.

Since 2023, I am working in Data Management and I am involved in Data Science activities for strongly correlated materials. My goal is to
provide a service for the scientific community. I develop the software behind the <a href="https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/">NOMAD Archive & Repository</a>, 
for computations in strongly correlated materials. In order to do that, I follow the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">F.A.I.R. principles</a>, i.e.,
data has to be organized to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
