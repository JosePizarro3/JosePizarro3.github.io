title: Strongly correlated materials
---

My main scientific activity has been to study and propose novel experiments for understanding the physics of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_correlated_material">strongly correlated materials</a>. These 
systems show a plethora of effects such as the Mott (metal-to-insulator) transition and Hund metallicity. These 
electronic-structure states are known to be intimately related with high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity and magnetism.

Thus, understanding these states and proposing new materials with such properties is key to solve 
the long-standing problem of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity and to exploit their full potential in
real world applications.

            My collaborators and I proposed to search for high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductivity in chromium pnictides 
            based on their potentially similar behavior with another class of high-T<sub>c</sub> superconductors, the
            iron-based superconductors. Taken from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.075115">J. M. Pizarro et al., <i>Strong correlations and the search for high-Tc superconductivity in chromium pnictides and chalcogenides</i>, Phys. Rev. B <b>95</b>, 075115 (2017)</a>.

I studied iron-based superconductors, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, and 2D materials. You can find a full
