title: Strongly correlated materials
---

My main scientific activity has been to study and propose novel experiments for understanding the physics of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mott_insulator">Mott insulators</a> and Hund's metals. These 
electronic-structure states are known to be intimately related with high-Tc superconducting phases. 
Thus, understanding these states is a key ingredient to solve the long-standing problem of high-Tc superconductivity.

            My collaborators and I proposed to search for high-Tc superconductivity in chromium pnictides due
            to their similarity with the iron-based superconductors.
