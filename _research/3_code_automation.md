title: Code automation
---

An important aspect of strongly correlated materials is to define a smaller sub-space of bands 
and to solve the Hubbard model for these subset. However, this _projection_ or _downfolding_ is
still a very human-involved problem, i.e., it needs a scientists deciding which bands to project
to.

In the recent years, there has been a huge push for automation of both simulations and experiments
in Materials Science. However, the aforementioned problem makes that still an expert in strong
correlations is needed to study what is happening in these materials.

I am currently working on improving this procedure to make the study of strongly correlated materials
more automated, or at least, with minimal human intervention.
