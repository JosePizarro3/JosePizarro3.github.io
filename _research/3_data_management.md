title: Data management
---

As of 2023, I am working in Data Management and I am involved in Data Science activities. My goal is to
provide service,
using the <a href="https://nomad-lab.eu/nomad-lab/">NOMAD Archive & Repository</a>, for calculations that are computationally
demanding (such as the ones I studied during my career). In order to do that, I am working in the
<a href="https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/">consortium FAIRmat</a>, where I try to organize data following 
the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>.

            Modern data life cycle: by following the FAIR principles, the data can be further reuse, expanding
            thus its life.
